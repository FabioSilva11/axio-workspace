/**
 * Execution-time filesystem binding for ONE agent run (item 14 of the
 * migration): the {@link AgentRuntime} pins the {@link WorkspaceIdentity}/
 * {@link WorkspaceFileSystem} resolved by the {@link RunContextFactory} at
 * run start, and every tool that resolves paths through static helpers (the
 * Void-ported registry, {@code ContextBuilder}, {@code ApplyPatchTool})
 * reads THIS binding instead of the global active workspace.
 *
 * <p><b>Run-scoped, not process-global.</b> The binding is keyed by the
 * run's {@code runId}, so concurrent runs on different threads never share
 * (or overwrite) each other's filesystem. Resolution order for a thread:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the thread's own nested binding (explicit install/uninstall),</li>
 *   <li>the binding of the run in flight ON THAT THREAD
 *       ({@code runId → binding}, resolved from the current thread),</li>
 *   <li>{@code null} — callers must fail closed; there is no silent
 *       fallback to the global active workspace inside the runtime.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Async provider/tool callbacks that capture the binding at enqueue time
 * keep resolving the same filesystem even when they run later, on another
 * thread: use {@link #snapshotOf(String)} / {@link #withRun(String, ...)} to
 * re-install the captured binding explicitly.</p>
